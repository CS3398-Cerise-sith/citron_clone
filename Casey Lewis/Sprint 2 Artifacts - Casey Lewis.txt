Sprint 2 Artifacts

https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop
Lots of time spent on the python.org site learning how to solve problems I
thought would be useful, but never ended up doing in this sprint. Research based.

Python switch statements tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgf1DlQnmI
3 minute video, plus about an hour of tinkering in python to get a better 
understanding.

Python switch case statement using dictionary...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMtckxSXY
8 minute video, ended up being useless because it was way over my head. Horrible
video... oh well.

try Django tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsLHt3D_jsE
watched the first 4 of 42 of these.. they were about 20 minutes total I think. 
Not very helpful so I stopped watching.
I also had a lot of trouble getting django to work on my computer but I met with
Blake outside of class and he showed me how it worked and helped me get a 
better understanding of it.


Pretty much all of my second sprint was spent on research and that is why I do 
not have any git commits.

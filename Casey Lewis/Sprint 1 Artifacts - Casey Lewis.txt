Hours were spent between doing this and at the same time making a homepage
for the group (going back and forth from each from learning to applying what I
learned)

The rest of the hours were spent on the website, creating the style and format.
I did not commit it myself because I had been collaborating with Blake on the 
Website because the style affected his heat map, and so I sent it to him and 
he committed it because I didn't understand git that well back then, and didn't 
want to mess up his files.
